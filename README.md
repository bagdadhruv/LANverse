# LANverse - Revolutionizing LAN Parties

Welcome to **LANverse**—the ultimate platform for organizing and hosting community-driven LAN (Local Area Network) parties! Whether you're a gamer, event organizer, or just looking for a place to have fun, **LANverse** is designed to bring people together by putting the power of event planning and participation in the hands of the community.

## Why LANverse?

Imagine a LAN party where everyone contributes—**by the participants, for the participants**. **LANverse** is built on the idea that the best events happen when everyone is involved. It’s not just about showing up; it's about actively contributing and shaping the party. From choosing the venue to selecting games, each attendee’s input is valued and celebrated.

## Key Features

- **Event Creation by Anyone**: No event organizers here! Any participant can create and start an event. Select the date, time, and location and watch the party grow.

- **Mandatory Resource Sharing**: To ensure the success of every event, every participant must contribute something—whether it's a venue (flat, garden, etc.), food, gaming gear, or even services like event setup.

- **Collaborative Game Selection**: Use community voting to decide which games will be played. Let the majority decide the fun!

- **Interactive Event Dashboard**: Track the event from start to finish, keep an eye on contributions, and see what's still needed. Transparency is key!

- **Badges & Recognition**: Top contributors receive recognition, exclusive badges, and rewards from the founders. Your contributions are not only appreciated—they’re celebrated!

## How It Works

1. **Create an Event**: Any participant can create an event and invite others to join.

2. **Share Resources**: Everyone contributes to the party—whether that’s providing a space, food, gaming consoles, or services like event coordination.

3. **Vote for Games**: Let everyone vote on what games will be played during the event. It’s a collaborative decision-making process!

4. **Track Progress**: Stay updated with what’s happening. Monitor contributions, see what’s still needed, and keep the event on track.

5. **Earn Recognition**: Earn badges, rewards, and get recognized for being an active contributor to the event.

## Why You Should Join
